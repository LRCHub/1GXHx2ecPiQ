Don't call my name out your window, I'm leavin'
I won't even turn my head
Don't send your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
I'll be gone, like I said

You'd just say the same old thing
That you be sayin' all along
Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till I'm gone
Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan

Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad-mouthin'
Understand your man

You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
While I'm untanglin' my mind

I ain't gonna repeat
What I said any more
While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone as the wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man, meditate on it

Understand your man, you hear me talking
Understand your man, remember what I told you
Understand your man
Understand your man.
